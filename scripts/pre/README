Introduction:
In this folder, you can create pre installation files that are sourced once for each 
server in a deployment, before the installation stage.

=== Pre Installation Scripts ===
Files are sourced in the following cascading order:

pre/[branch]/[server]/pre.sh  - Run only on a specific server for a specific branch
pre/[branch]/pre.sh           - Run on every server, but only for a specific branch
pre/[server]/pre.sh			  - Run only on a specific server
pre/pre.sh                    - Run on every server for every branch

The first one that is found is executed and, by default, the process stops searching
for any further pre.sh scripts. If you want it to keep cascading, i.e. to run a script
for a specific server, but then also run a global script, then set the varaible 
"NEXT=true" before the pre-script exits, and it will continue searching for the next 
script to run.

=== Environment Scripts ===
You can also set environment variables in a reverse cascade order to the pre install
scripts, before the pre.sh scripts are run.

They are sourced in the following order, so you can set defaults in the first env.sh
file, which are then potentially overridden with lower files.
pre/env.sh                    - Global defaults go here
pre/[server]/env.sh           - Server specific overrides go here
pre/[branch]/env.sh           - Branch specific overrides go here
pre/[branch]/[server]/env.sh  - Server overrides for a specific branch go here

Unlike the pre.sh cascade search, the env.sh cascade search does not stop at the first
file it finds, instead it keeps searching for and executing all further env.sh files as
they are found.
