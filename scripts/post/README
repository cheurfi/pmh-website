Introduction:
In this folder, you can create post deployment files that are sourced once for each
server in a deployment, after all other stages have run.

=== Post Deploy Scripts ===
Files are sourced in the following cascading order:

post/[branch]/[server]/post.sh  - Run only on a specific server for a specific branch
post/[branch]/post.sh           - Run on every server, but only for a specific branch
post/[server]/post.sh			- Run only on a specific server
post/post.sh                    - Run on every server for every branch

The first one that is found is executed and, by default, the process stops searching 
for any further post.sh scripts. If you want it to keep cascading, i.e. to run a script 
for a specific server, but then also run a global script, then set the variable 
"NEXT=true" before the post-script exits, and it will continue searching for the next 
script to run.

=== Environment Scripts ===
You can also set environment variables in a reverse cascade order to the post deploy
scripts, before the post.sh scripts are run.

They are sourced in the following order, so you can set defaults in the first env.sh
file, which are then potentially overridden with lower files.
post/env.sh                    - Global defaults go here
post/[server]/env.sh           - Server specific overrides go here
post/[branch]/env.sh           - Branch specific overrides go here
post/[branch]/[server]/env.sh  - Server overrides for a specific branch go here

Unlike the post.sh cascade search, the env.sh cascade search does not stop at the first
file it finds, instead it keeps searching for and executing all further env.sh files as
they are found.
